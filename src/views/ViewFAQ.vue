          <h3 class="font-hand-writing-1 text-center mb-7">
            It's definitely the CD Tofu. ($15.00(M) â€¢ $16.00(L)) This dish is
            made with a combination of Red Soup, Soft Tofu, Shrimp, Clam, Beef,
            Egg and Green onion.

              How many hours in advance do you need to make a reservation?
            </span>
          </h3>
          <h3 class="font-hand-writing-1 text-center mb-7">
            We can accommodate walk-ins, but calling one to two hours in advance
            is recommended to guarantee a table.

              Can you make a tofu soup that is absolutely not spicy?
            </span>
          </h3>
          <h3 class="font-hand-writing-1 text-center mb-7">
            Yes. Just make sure that the tofu soup is not spicy at all when you
            order it. We will make the soup mild by using a different spice
            blend.

            We're sorry that we don't have birthday cakes available, but you're
